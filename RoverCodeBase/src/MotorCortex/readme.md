# Motor Cortex - Physical Control Systems

The Motor Cortex manages physical movement and interaction pathways, coordinating:

## Rover Radio - Sensory Extension Module
- Dual expansion ports for enhanced sensory capabilities
- Cross-modal integration of audio and visual stimuli
- Extensible neural pathway connections

## RoverByte - Autonomous Mobility Platform
- Complete quadrupedal locomotion system
- Advanced proprioceptive feedback
- Integrated balance and gait control
- Multi-modal environmental sensing

## Future Neural Integration
- Docking station for energy replenishment
- Autonomous exploration behaviors
- Environmental mapping and navigation
- Social interaction patterns
- Self-preservation instincts

The Motor Cortex serves as the primary interface between cognitive processing and physical action, enabling complex behavioral responses through coordinated movement control.
