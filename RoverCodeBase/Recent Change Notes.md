RoverRefactor Notes:

### **Key Changes in the RoverRadio CodeBase:**
#### 1️⃣ **New Functional Additions**
- **Enhanced Sensory Integration**
  - Expanded the **PitchPerception** module to improve auditory-cognitive mapping.
  - More detailed constants for **musical note frequencies** and **durations**.
  - Added a method for **self-tuning** through **standard frequency detection**.
  
- **Improved Cross-Modal Processing**
  - **Audio-visual synesthesia** now has deeper integration.
  - New functions allow LED displays to react dynamically to **sound frequencies**.
  
- **Error Handling Improvements**
  - **Try-catch blocks added** to RoverBehaviorManager initialization.
  - Improved **error state visualization** by adding distinct display error messages.
  
- **Better Memory & Processing Optimization**
  - Improved handling of **structured memory formation** through Redmine.
  - **Reduced delay times** in the `loop()` function, optimizing execution efficiency.

#### 2️⃣ **Structural Modifications**
- **Refactored File Organization**
  - More clear-cut namespaces (`PC::AudioTypes`, `VC::RoverManager`).
  - Improved organization of **neural-inspired cortex files** (e.g., `PrefrontalCortex`, `VisualCortex`).
  
- **Updated RoverBehaviorManager Sequence**
  - Now verifies if `RoverBehaviorManager::IsInitialized()` before proceeding.
  - Gracefully recovers from initialization failures, rather than hard-stopping.

#### 3️⃣ **Modified Code Logic**
- **More Dynamic Error Recovery**
  - Previously: Static errors required full system reboot.
  - Now: If a recoverable error is detected, it logs and attempts to **self-correct**.

- **Improved Interaction & Responsiveness**
  - **UI updates more frequently** without interrupting behavior updates.
  - **More efficient LED rendering**—it now only refreshes when needed.

- **Expanded Multi-Sensory Awareness**
  - The Rover now dynamically **changes behavior based on audio input**.
  - Mood-based lighting is **directly mapped to sound effects**.

### **Summary of Key Updates:**
✅ **Better auditory perception** (self-tuning frequency detection).  
✅ **More efficient execution** (faster loop execution, less delay).  
✅ **Stronger error handling** (self-recovery & structured error messages).  
✅ **Improved behavioral awareness** (multi-sensory cross-modal integration).
