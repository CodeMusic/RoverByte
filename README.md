## 🌍 What is RoverByte?  

RoverByte, or Rover for short, is an **AI-driven, multi-project ecosystem** that blends robotics, task management, and real-world interaction into a **seamless intelligent assistant**.  
From **RoverRadio** (RF-based task automation) to **RoverByte** (your quadrupedal robotic companion), Rover is more than just a collection of gadgets—it's a **networked intelligence** designed to **help, adapt, and grow with you**.  

**Core Functions:**  
✅ **AI-Assisted Task Management** (via **RoverSeer**, powered by Redmine)  
✅ **Modular Robotics** (from handheld devices to full robotic assistants)  
✅ **Gamification & Engagement** (**ByteCoins economy, Tamagotchi mode**)  
✅ **Machine Learning for Real-World Recognition** (**RoverDex**)  

RoverByte evolves with **three core priorities:**  
1. **Current Focus:** **RoverRadio** → Embedded RF automation for task management.  
2. **Next Phase:** **RoverSeer** → The Redmine-powered home base that connects all Rovers.  
3. **Future Vision:** **RoverByte** → Your **AI-driven robotic companion**—bringing it all together.
